## 🧐 Key Insights & Explanations

- 🛫 **Flights with Chennai or Kolkata** as source/destination tend to be costlier due to fewer flight options and less competition.
- 🏙️ **Delhi flights** are cheaper on average due to high traffic volume and more airline choices.
- 🧳 **Only Air India and Vistara** offer Business Class since they are full-service carriers, unlike budget airlines.
- ⏰ **Morning and Evening flights** are expensive due to high demand (business hours).
- 🌙 **Early Morning and Late Night flights** are cheaper as they’re less preferred by most passengers.
